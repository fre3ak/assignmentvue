# Note app project
vue.js and pouchDB
I visited the link and realised that its a note taking application, i used the "inspect element" to study the application, i figured it was developed using the vue.js and pouchDB
I studied the codes carefully and went into replication
I developed mine using the same framework and database using the initial code as guide in developing the replica
